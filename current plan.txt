add true/false (accept/reject file request) to first packet to client
add string message to first packet to client

[client]
When player tries to join server send them to "joining..." UI with progress bar
Create proper Player-accepted-to-server hook
on Player-accepted-to-server hook:
ask server what files we need
wait for response
if we get a false flag, display the message and go back to title
if we get a yes flag, start the current download routine
start and update progress bar on UI with LargeRPC.OnProgressUpdatated
on LargeRPC.OnComplete, display "spawning world"
CREATE SPAWN WORLD ROUTINE - maybe just wait for MLAPI to finish
on world spawn finished, display "starting lua"
load any lua files in lua/client and lua/server (we'll make this more elaborate later with gamemode folders and stuff)
